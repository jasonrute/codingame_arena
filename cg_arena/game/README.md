**Everything in the `cg_arena/game` directory is specific to a CodinGame competition.**

_Currently it is the **Wondev Women** competition, but that is just an example._

Any CodinGame competition can be implemented by changing the `Game`
class found in `cg_arena/game/__init__`.  The `Game` should follow
the API in the `GameABC` abstract base class found in
`cg_arena/game_abc`.
